## Overview
Available for use on [Disctuit](https://discuit.net)

You can comment `!wave` to summon the bot, and have it generate flags for the content of the main post. Image posts will get best result, since it will always be an image, Link posts should be direct links to flags (jpeg, png, etc) while the bot will scrape any Text posts for links to images, and display all of them. 

You can also comment `!wavethis` to have it generate flags from any/all links to images in your comment.

There is no relation to the [Reddit FlagWaverReborn](https://github.com/Lunar-Dawn/FlagWaverBotReborn?tab=readme-ov-file), other than to mimic the summoning behaviour for use on Discuit.
